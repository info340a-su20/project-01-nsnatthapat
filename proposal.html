    <h1>Topic Proposal - Natt</h1>
    <div>Problem Description</div>
    <p>My domain of interest for the INFO 340 project is University Admissions. University research is a 
        time consuming and confusing process for high school 
        students as well as those looking to pursue graduate degrees. 
        While the internet is full of information on colleges and 
        universities such as location, tuition, acceptance rate, safety, etc there lacks a centralized platform where people can perform their research on. Instead, most individuals resort to researching and reading reviews on a variety of websites, which is very time consuming. Drawbacks of existing solutions such as Niche.com are that they do not support international students as they only contain college information for US Universities. In addition, they also do not provide insight into the travel restrictions placed upon that country due to COVID-19. 
    </p>
    <div>Proposed Application</div>
    <p>The main users of the app will be high school seniors looking for information about prospective universities. 
        Thus, the data they will be viewing are statistics and information that may influence their decision on which 
        colleges to apply to/attend such as acceptance rate, average admission scores, location, tuition, overall ranking, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>They will be able to interact with the web app through the use of filters in order to find the university that best 
        matches their preferences as well as add universities that are not currently on the list to the list. 
        The existence of this app will be a solution to the complicated process of college research because it provides a centralized 
        platform for all college admissions information.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the main interactive functions of the platform includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search</li>
        <li>Filters</li>
        <li>Input</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some examples of applications that I draw inspiration from that also centralize college admissions information
        are <a href="https://www.niche.com/">Niche</a> and <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/compare-colleges">CollegeBoard BigFuture</a>
